#### technical description

this is a meteor app built using react. we implimented use of google's custom search engine to generate random image
comparisons and google's cloud storage to store copies of those images to preserve the integrity of the urls. we used mlabs

images through ibm watson to gatherer more information to be used on the stats page.
